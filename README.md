# Backend Server for Unreal Map Bridge 

#### Use real world heightmap data from Mapbox or Maptiler and automatically convert it to an Unreal heightmap image

# Check out the front end demo running live  [here](https://map.justgeektechs.com/)

This backend server is only needed if you are combining over 1000 tiles, else the webapp will handle the combining  


You can download the repo and either run the standalone server included in the dist folder or install node and run npm install and then npm start.
